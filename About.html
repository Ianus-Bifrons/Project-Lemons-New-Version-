<p>The “Project Lemons” is a decision maker’s tool that will help the users choose the best ideas based on the negative rating of each one. According to research, people can better pick the worst ideas instead of picking up the best. The system will use that finding and let its users negatively rate the ideas.</p>

<p>The way the system works is by assigning “lemons” to the ideas, more lemons mean the idea is worse. There are two rounds, each round has five ideas and ten lemons available.The user can choose how he will distribute the lemons however, an idea can have up to five lemons. After the second round, the user will be presented with a confirmation page. There he will be able to see each idea and the number of lemons he assigned to each one.</p>

<p>Users will be able to rerun the app by pressing the “Rerun” button at the end. Each time the system reruns, the combination of the questions will be different. It is important to note that the lemons assigned to each question will be saved in the system, even when the user chooses to rerun the app.</p>
